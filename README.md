# NODE-REACT-TEST
Simple application with Node.js + Express backend and React + TypeScript frontend

Project conatain two folders client and server

In bot folders you need to install npm packages with command: npm i

You need to provide valid connection link for the MongoDB server (local or remote) /server/server.js line 29
But if you don't want to, I'll give you connection link, after which you need to contact me to set your IP address in the whitelist

After that both client and server are started with command (in their respective folders): npm run dev

When you get positive feedback that both server and client are running and server is connected to Mongo server 
go to browser on location: http://localhost:3000 to access the application

Let me know if this project is good and if you need my help with anything.

Thanks
